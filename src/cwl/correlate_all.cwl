  Simple tool to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between
  several given pairs of columns of a tab-separated file
  
  This workflow is intended to demonstrate a possible solution to the 
  following imaginary problem: having a tab-separated values file 
  with several columns, we would like to select one numerical column 
  (main variable) and explore how other numerical columns correlate with it.
  
  Disclaimer: The actual problem can be easily solved with a 
  simple Python, R, Java or C program. The purpose here 
  though is not to present a use real-world case for a workflow definition 
  language but to show how to use CWL.
  
  The workflow performs the following steps:
  
  1. Cleanse the data 
    * The original file contains some unparseable values, e.g., “(null)” for numeric data
    * Use grep to remove rows with unparseable values
  2. For every column that we would like to correlate with the main variable, 
     calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficient using Python pandas package
     This can be done in parallel, using scatter directive
  3. Combine results of the step 2 into a single file and sort it
  4. Plot a bar chart, showing correlations using gnuplot
  
  
  Inline comments are not added this workflow intentionally to 
  improve readability. The workflow is commented in the 
  Google slides:
